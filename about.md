<br>

Hi there! I often write about finance, technology, and honestly whatever else I find interesting. I used to work as a derivatives trader and backend software engineer before earning my MBA, and I am now a management consultant. Outside of work, you can find me running along the water in Brooklyn and sampling everything bagels and dirty martinis throughout New York. If you have any comments or questions, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to contact me at andrew.lindner.blog@gmail.com
