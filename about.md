<br>
I am currently a software engineer at a bank and write backend programs in Ruby. As a former derivatives trader, I am interested in the intersection between finance and technology. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, running, and critiquing New York City bagels. If you have any comments or questions, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to contact me at andrew.lindner.blog@gmail.com
