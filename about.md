<br>
Hi there! I'm Andrew Lindner and am currently an MBA Candidate at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Before moving to Chicago, I spent 6 years in New York City where I first worked as a derivatives trader at MUFG and then a backend software engineer at BNY Mellon. Given my professional backgrounds, I often write about both finance and technology. Outside of school, you can find me running along the Lakefront Trail, listening to classic rock, and exploring the Chicago restaurant scene. If you have any comments or questions, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to contact me at andrew.lindner.blog@gmail.com
