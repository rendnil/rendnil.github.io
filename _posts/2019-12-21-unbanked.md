---
FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households
https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/2017/2017execsumm.pdf
survey conducted in 2017
surveyed over 35,000 households in the US

unbanked - "no one in the household had a checking or savings account"

An additional 18.7 percent of U.S. households were “un-derbanked” in 2017, meaning that the household had an account at an insured institution but also obtained finan-cial products or services outside of the banking system. Specifically, a household is categorized as underbanked if it had a checking or savings account and used one of the following products or services from an alternative finan-cial services (AFS) provider in the past 12 months: money orders, check cashing, international remittances, payday loans, refund anticipation loans, rent-to-own services, pawn shop loans, or auto title loans.
