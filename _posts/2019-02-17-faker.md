title: Quickly Seed Your Database With Faker
---

For those unacquainted with it, [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) is a Ruby gem that developers can use to generate random data from a multitude of categories. For example, users can direct Faker to retrieve a random quote from an ancient Greek philosopher or the name of a planet from the Star Wars universe. In an effort to efficiently test and inject some creativity in my applications, I often incorporate Faker in my backend seed file.

## INSTALLATION
To set up the Faker gem, simply run the following command:

```
gem install faker
```

Alternatively, place the following line in your project’s Gemfile (run `bundle install` after updating the Gemfile):
```
gem 'faker'
```

Lastly, insert this line at the top of the `seeds.rb` file:

```
require 'faker'
```
