title: Excellent Public APIs to Use in Your Next Application
---
For many web developers, discovering a comprehensive and intuitive API can be akin to striking oil. Below I have listed several first-rate APIs that I have used, along with several that I have tagged for future exploration. As a bonus, these APIs do not require a key or any additional authentication.

## IEX
The [IEX API](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#getting-started) has quickly emerged as my definitive resource for financial market information. IEX offers a plethora of relevant data on equity markets and includes time-series data, financial indicators, and current news articles. Furthermore, for those applications that require WebSocket integration, IEX distributes several of its datasets through its socket.io server.

## CoinDesk
[This API](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-api) is ideal for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and contains information on bitcoin’s market price. In addition to delivering data on real-time pricing, CoinDesk also disseminates historical time-series price information.

## TVmaze
The [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) offers a variety of data on current and past television shows. In particular, its endpoints provide data about a show’s episodes, actors, and schedule. Developers can additionally access information on specific actors.

Some of its datasets include economic indicators, climate data, specific financial figures, and World Bank operations.
