title: Excellent Public APIs to Use in Your Next Application
---
For many web developers, discovering a comprehensive and intuitive API can be akin to striking oil. Below I have listed several first-rate APIs that I have used, along with several that I have tagged for future exploration. As a bonus, these APIs do not require a key or any additional authentication.

## IEX
The <a href="https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/#getting-started" target="_blank">IEX</a> has quickly emerged as my definitive resource for financial market information. IEX offers a plethora of relevant data on equity markets and includes time-series data, financial indicators, and current news articles. Furthermore, for those applications that require WebSocket integration, IEX distributes several of its datasets through its socket.io server.
