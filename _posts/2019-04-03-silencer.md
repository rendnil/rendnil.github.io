title: Quiet Those Noisy Logs
---

Have you ever wasted time sifting through log messages to find the useful information? The <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/silencer" target="_blank">Silencer</a> Ruby gem allows you to suppress logging for specified actions and quickly identify the signals hidden within the noise.
This can be incredibly useful when you have a long running processing that produces log messages but does not provide any valuable information.

## INSTALLATION

As with most gems, the installation is relatively straightforward.

Add the following line to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'silencer'
```

Then, install the gem:
```
bundle install
```

---

## SAMPLE USE

Create a new file in your `config/initializers` folder named `silencer.rb`

Lastly, require the gem and add code along these lines:

```ruby
require 'silencer/logger'

Rails.application.configure do
  config.middleware.swap(
    Rails::Rack::Logger,
    Silencer::Logger,
    silence: ['/annoying_action']
  )
end

```

The above will silence the logging any request made to the `/annoying_action` endpoint. You can substitute `silence` for `get`, `post`, or other HTTP verbs to quiet specific requests.
